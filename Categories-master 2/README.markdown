Categories by section71
=======================

In this repository you will find the categories I'm using in my iOS/OSX projects. I'll try to give credit where credit is due because most of the categories where done by searching StackOverflow if I run into a problem. If you think I should credit you for the code just let me know and I'll add your name.

I will comment the code if it's necessary to understand it, but it's mostly undocumented ;-)

Normally I won't include an `#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>` because it's already present in the `<Project>-Prefix.pch`
